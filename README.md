### Background

This repo contains the scaffolding of a simple Rails list management application.

### Description

The Lists app allows the user to view and edit nested lists of content.

Initial feature list:
- the user can view root level items
- that's it

**Implement the following feature set by extending the codebase.**

#### Features

- the user can view fully nested items
- items maintain an order defined in the data model (add a position column). This was done upon "save", though event listeners could have been used to save position upon 'sortstop'. However, since there was a "save" button already, I assumed it was used to trigger the function that saves the reordered positions
- the user can collapse the nested item views (like closing a folder in a file explorer)
- the user can edit the title and content values of each item and save the state to the database. 
- the user can drag and drop to reorder the items within a list
- the user can drag and drop to nest an item under a different list

#### Parameters

- The application should be single-page and communicate with the server using AJAX
- You can include any open source libraries you want, with the exception of full JavaScript frameworks like Ember and Angular.
In other words, stick with Backbone!

#### Requirements

Fork this repo in github and send us the link to your project once you are done.

- Optimize for good object-oriented design and an organized codebase
- Readability is very important, comments are useful to explain tricky bits of logic, but use them sparingly
- Don't worry about styling or visual aesthetics

#### Getting Started

You will need to have a working Rails environment with sqlite. Once you have cloned the repo, run `rake db:setup`. If you run into any issues getting started, email us and we can help.
